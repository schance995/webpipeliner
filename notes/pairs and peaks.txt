Contrasts:
Each line: Group2 \t Group1 \t readcount \t num samples
Are there any restrictions on the uniqueness of Group1/Group2, besides that the groups must be defined as in groups.tab?

Are contrast files 4 columns wide or 2 columns wide?

Pairs: each tumor is unique. Are there any other restrictions?
Each line: Normal\tTumor\n

Peaks: is this the same as a contrasts.tab file?
