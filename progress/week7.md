# What I did this week
- Tried creating a 1 page form using JS
- The result didn't look good (select field not working properly)
- Removed login/logout functionality for now

# TODO
- (done) Reorder the form inputs: directory + pipeline first, email/id/other information second.
- Update checks for contrasts.tab (4 columns) and groups.tab (ignore duplicates)
- Add checks for pairs.tab, peakcall.tab, and contrast.tab (not a typo)
- Report the number of samples in the data dir, and the existence of any special files (groups, etc)
- Improve flash header clarity
- Write some documentation for how to extend this project
- (done) Remove placeholders in form inputs (not necessary)
- (done) Disable the submit button when it is clicked to prevent slowdowns
- Add some attributes/css (autofocus, error highlighting (invalid), etc)
- issue: adding errors after form validation but they don't show up on webpage.
