Due to my final exam and starting a new class I haven't been able to accomplish much this week.

I added a file upload button for groups and store the groups in a json format in the user session.

# Questions
- A lot of the frontend requires backend in order to even imagine what it does (for example, accessing a remote directory) What should I be working on besides simulating the missing functionality?
- Is it necessary to have a group selection functionality as shown on the website last meeting? This might take a lot of time to complete.
- Should I update the form checks to test the new contrasts.tab file format?
- Would it be ok to work less on said form checks and just provide a way for someone else to add them later? This might save some time.
