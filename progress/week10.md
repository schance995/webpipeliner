# Final touches were made
- fixed the read_groups function to reject directories with 0 relevant files ☑
- Hide the logout page ☑
- Make the about page the landing page, and add a button to access the form. ☑ (used a link instead)
- Report special .tab files found in dir ☑
- Clean up and modularize some more code (incomplete)
  - In particular cleaning up forms.py is tricky due to function dictionary
  - Sorry I coded it that way
- Add doc strings (incomplete)
- Add JS notification on submit (did not do)
  - Might be harder than it looks given that an ajax call needs to be made, and then js needs to listen back for success or failure
  - Would be somewhat tedious (my fault for coding it that way)

# Anything else? And thanks!
- I will finish some final comments/code reorganization before school resumes (September 1st)
