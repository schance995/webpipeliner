# What I've done this week
1. Dynamic forms are here!
2. Added details, submit, about page
3. Started working on Details form for RNASeq
4. Otherwise didn't do much, busy with exam

# Demo
- The app remembers previous form inputs through user sessions
- Previous form inputs are deleted on logout, but not if user leaves the page
- Three of the pipelines are easy as they require no extra details
- Quality Control Analysis requires text entry

# Next Steps
1. Add file uploads for RNASeq
2. Add verification of text files
3. Not sure about after that

# Questions
1. What are the files that the web app should be checking?
2. Can we combine initialize/dry run/run in fewer steps?
3. What is the expected run time of the analysis commands?
4. Any news on a Biowulf account for me?
