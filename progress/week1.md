# What I've done this week
1. Learned Python Flask basics
2. Started programming website
  - I call it 'WebPipeliner'
  - Login through SSH (disabled for now)
  - Form for basic details
  - Demo

# How to use WebPipeliner
1. Login
2. Provide basic details, pipeline + family + genome
3. Provide pipeline-specific details
4. Upload data
5. Review form inputs before running
6. Run
7. Not sure what to do from here
  - Running/success status?

# Next Steps
1. The specific detail forms
2. File uploads
3. Learn JavaScript
4. Dynamic forms so that form fields presented to user change based on pipeline

# Questions
1. Thoughts on my progress/next steps?
2. What does the "dry run" do?
3. How large are the input files?
4. How do we send the user the finished output?
  - through email?
  - as a .zip or other compressed file on the server available for download (for a limited time?)
5. Security requirements?
  - should I log the user out if they close the tab?
6. Which pipeline(s) should I focus on first?
  - Not all of them have been implemented, I was thinking of RNASeq since that has documentation
