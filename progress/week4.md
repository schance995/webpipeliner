# What I've done this week
- Basic checks for filenames and contents of groups.tabs and contrasts.tab
- I had more homework to do this week so I couldn't do as much

# Demo + Issues
- Something that's not supposed to work is that you can skip to the Submit page with incorrect form data
- You can't enter tab characters in the textbox as it advances to the next button
- Tab characters can still be pasted in however

# Next Steps
- Fix the above issue
- Fix formatting of MinCPM and MinSamples field to match GUI
- Allow for file upload of groups/contrasts
- Simulate initialize/dry run/run buttons
- Next week is final exam so I will be busy

# Questions
1. What to do about tab characters? Maybe we should require the user to upload files instead of just typing them in.
2. Currently form inputs are stored in the user session. Since users have to log in, should they be stored on the server instead?
3. Any account for me?
