# What I've done this week
1. Read some JavaScript documentation
2. Started coding JavaScript for dynamic forms (using JQuery)
3. Added a favicon (from a picture stored in pipeliner)
4. Changed some aesthetics on the front page form
5. I can log into the same app on two web browsers (the current security standards of the app currently aren't very high...)
6. Demo

# That's it?
- The learning curve was (a lot) higher this week
- I had to rewrite a lot of code to get JQuery to work properly

# Next Steps
1. Dynamic forms
2. Create Step 2 page: details
   - User can enter specific data based on the options they selected in Step 1
3. Improve security

# Questions
1. What should I call (family + pipeline + genome)? I can't think of a shorter name, and 'data' sounds too generic.
2. What license should I give this project? I based it off of someone else's project which was hosted under the MIT license and am not familiar with this licensing thing.
3. Any news on whether I have a Biowulf account?
4. Discussing logins
